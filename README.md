HOW TO INSTALL:
as any other plugin, add multi_language.as to your default_plugins.txt. 

should look like this:
```
	"plugin"
	{
		"name" "Multi-Language"
		"script" "multi_language"
	}
```

then register the game_text_custom on the campaigns/maps you want to have localizations. 

should look like this:
```
#include "multi_language"

void MapInit()
{
	MultiLanguageInit();
}

void MapActivate()
{
	MultiLanguageActivate();
}
```

please. if you do a localization for any maps, let me know so i add them on the list.

**Please do not repack this script**
Link them to this Github's Latest release.
if not, at least keep your page updated because more languages support could be added.


Doing localizations:

1-	create a .ent file with the name of the map you want to add localization.
		see scripts/maps/multi_language/localizations/ first before you do anything.

2-	add there all the game_text n/or env_messages that map uses like if it was a ent file.
	FORMAT:
```
"entity"
{
	"message" "damn"
	"message_spanish" "carajo"
	"message_portuguese" "caralho"
	"targetname" "scientist_die"
	"dont forget all the other values from the original text" ":p"
	"classname" "game_text_custom"
}
"entity"
{
	"more of the same" ":)"
	"classname" "game_text_custom"
}
```

-3 tell the script that you did a language. change the value of the language you did to "1"
0 mean disabled, 1 mean enabled.
```
"entity"
{
"$i_message" "1"
"$i_message_spanish" "1"
"$i_message_portuguese" "1"
"$i_message_german" "0"
"$i_message_french" "0"
"$i_message_italian" "0"
"$i_message_esperanto" "0"
"classname" "info_target"
"targetname" "language"
}
```

-4 let me know that you did a localization.


once the script is in a certain map. it'll check if a .ent with the same name exist. if yes all game_text and env_message will be removed from the world and your game_text_custom in the .ent file will be generated.
